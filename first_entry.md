Hi <p>
So yesterday was the first course day of KB8024. I made my first GitHub account and learnt how to add, commit and push
which is as I understand it the most imporatnt commands when using GitHub.


GitHub works two ways. you can either make a repository online and clone it to your computer. OR you can create the repository on your computer and then add, commit and push the new repository to GitHub. 

```{% highlight ruby lineos %}
mkdir diary
cd diary
git init
git status
{% endhighlight %}
```
