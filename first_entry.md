Hi <p>
So yesterday was the first course day of KB8024. I made my first GitHub account and learnt how to add, commit and push
which is as I understand it the most imporatnt commands when using GitHub.


GitHub works two ways. you can either make a repository online and clone it to your computer. OR you can create the repository on your computer and then add, commit and push the new repository to GitHub. 

Make a repository localy:
```
$ mkdir diary
$ cd diary
$ git init        #this creates the hidden folder git which makes it a repository
$ git status      
```
The `git status` should give a output looking like this:
```
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```
